"""
screen_wrap.py
===
Move the circle from top to bottom, but when it reaches the bottom, change the circle's x and y coordinates so that it starts at the top again.

1. Copy the boilerplate code from the template exercise - hello_pygame.py.
2. Rewrite the top to bottom animation code.
3. Write a conditional in the while loop that checks if the circle is at the bottom of the screen.
4. Make the radius of the circle into a variable, and use it to augment your boundary conditions for the bottom of the screen
